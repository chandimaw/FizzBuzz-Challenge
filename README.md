# FizzBuzz-Challenge

So, I decided to take up the challenge to do the FizzBuzz test in Ruby which turned out to be simple. 

An example of a Fizz-Buzz question is the following:
Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three print “Fizz” instead of the number and for the multiples of five print “Buzz”. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print “FizzBuzz”.

Most good programmers should be able to write out on paper a program which does this in a under a couple of minutes.
Want to know something scary? – the majority of computer science graduates can’t. I’ve also seen self-proclaimed senior programmers take more than 10-15 minutes to write a solution.
